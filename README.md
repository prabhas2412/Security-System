# Security-System
In the present day, safety and security are becoming essential for the purpose of improving our life condition. In this project I presented a part of safety and security system using Sensors (Temperature sensor, Gas sensor, PIR motion sensor), LCD display, GSM and Bluetooth Technology using a mobile device, so it will more easy and efficient to use. This system is based on Android and Arduino platform both of which are free open source software and also having a lock/unlock facility and only registered user can lock/unlock the system through android application that I have developed and system is able to take readings from different sensors and send the alert SMS to the owner in case of any mishappenings. 
In this project android smart phone is working as the task master, Bluetooth module as command agent, Arduino microcontroller as controller center / data processing center, LCD display module for displaying performed operations, DC fan as a cooing agent and GSM module for sending an alert message to owner/admin.

Hardware Requirement: Arduino-UNO board, Android Mobile, HC-05 Bluetooth Module, SIM-900 GSM Module, MQ-2 Gas/Smoke Sensor, LM-35 Temperature Sensor, PIR Motion Detector, 12 V Cooling Fan, 16*2 LCD display, LED lights, Servo Motor, Lock.

Software Requirement: Android Studio, Arduino IDE, WAMP Server (for database connectivity).
